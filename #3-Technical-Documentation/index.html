      <header>Introduction</header>
      <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a
      host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide
      programmatic control over them.</p>
      <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements
      such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by
      supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model
          (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user
          events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For
          example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information
          from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <section class="main-section" id="javascript_and_java">
      <header>Javascript and Java</header>
      <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language
      resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression
      syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to
      JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based
      on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based
      object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic
      inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any
      special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="hello_world">
      <header>Hello World</header>
      <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
      <code class="code">
        function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
        greetMe("World");
      </code>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="variables">
      <header>Variables</header>
      <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform
      to certain rules.</p>
      <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be
      digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the
      characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="constants">
      <header>Constants</header>
      <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as
      for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric,
      or underscore characters.</p>
      <code class="code">const PI = 3.14</code>
      <p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has to be
      initialized to a value.</p>
      <p>The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the
      identifier is assumed to represent a variable.</p>
      <p>You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example:</p>
      <code class="code">// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS
      WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g;
      //statements }</code>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="data_types">
      <header>Data Types</header>
      <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Six data types that are primitives:
          <ul>
            <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
            <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL,
            or any other variant.</li>
            <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
            <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
            <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
            <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>and Object</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="if_else_statement">
      <header>if else statement</header>
      <p>Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else clause to execute a
      statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:
      </p>
      <code class="code">if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
      <p>condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to
      true and false. If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise, statement_2 is executed. statement_1
      and statement_2 can be any statement, including further nested if statements.</p>
      <p>You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested in sequence, as follows:</p>
      <code class="code">if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) {
      statement_2; } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else {
      statement_last; }
      </code>
